# CISC479-blogProject

This project was an assignment for a University of Delaware class, CISC 467 - Intro to Client-Side Engineering

This assignment involved using firebase service as a database like structure to hold the comments and posts of a forum.  This forum did not involve user login.  It was an open forum, where users would enter their names in the new post/comment form, instead of using their account name.
